A timeline is a container for tweens where you place them in time (like a schedule). 
They can overlap or have gaps between them; you have total control. As the timeline's playhead moves, 
it scrubs across its child tweens and renders them accordingly! Insert as many as you want and control 
the entire group as a whole with the standard methods (play(), reverse(), pause(), etc.).
 You can even nest timelines within timelines!
